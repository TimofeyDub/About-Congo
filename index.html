        <h1>About Kongo</h1>
        <p style="max-width: 700px; margin: auto;">The Republic of the Congo (French République du Congo [ʁepyblik dy kɔ̃ɡo], Congo Repubilika ya Kongo, Lingala Republíki ya Kongó), also Congo-Brazzaville, is a state in Central Africa, a former colonial possession of France, from 1970 to 1991 - the People's Republic of the Congo. The country is bordered to the west by Gabon, to the northwest by Cameroon and to the northeast by the Central African Republic, to the southeast by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the south by the Angolan exclave of Cabinda, and to the southwest by the Atlantic Ocean. French is the official language of the Republic of Congo. The capital is the city of Brazzaville. Around 3,000 years ago, the region was dominated by Bantu-speaking tribes who built trade links into the Congo Basin. Congo was formerly part of the French colony of Equatorial Africa. The Republic of the Congo was formed on November 28, 1958 and gained independence from France in 1960. It was a Marxist-Leninist state from 1969 to 1992 called the People's Republic of the Congo. The sovereign state has held multiparty elections since 1992, although the democratically elected government was overthrown in the Republic of Congo's civil war in 1997, and President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who first came to power in 1979, has ruled for more than 40 years. The Republic of the Congo is a member of the African Union, the United Nations, the Francophonie Community, the Economic Community of Central African States and the Non-Aligned Movement. It has become the fourth largest oil producer in the Gulf of Guinea, providing the country with a degree of prosperity despite political and economic instability in some areas and the unequal distribution of oil revenues throughout the country. Congo's economy is heavily dependent on the oil sector, and economic growth has slowed significantly since oil prices fell since 2015. With a population of 5.2 million, 88.5% of the country is Christian.</p>
